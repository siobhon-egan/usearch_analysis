# usearch_analysis

Set of pipelines and scripts for analysis of sequence data using [USEARCH](https://drive5.com/usearch/), a program developed by Robert Edgar.

Each script is written as 'stand alone' however will require you have installed appropriate version USEARCH and adjust directories and file names as needed.

I maintain a webpage on NGS sequence analysis (currently focused on amplicon illumia MiSeq data) that contains a variety of pipelines, code, examples and lots of links.
